**XDAetherium** is an Android launcher for running **Minecraft: Java Edition** on phones and tablets. It is based on Amethyst/PojavLauncher/Boardwalk and includes custom changes for a smaller APK, Ely.by accounts, working Ely.by skins, custom branding, and Android Java runtime fixes.

## Build status

The current local debug build was tested on an Android 12 device:

- debug package: `org.angelauramc.amethyst.debug`
- versionName: `LOCAL-20260510`
- debug APK size: about `82 MB`
- ABI: `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`
- no x86/x86_64 libraries in the APK

## Building from source

### Requirements

- JDK compatible with this project's Android Gradle Plugin.
- Android SDK.
- Android NDK `27.3.13750724` or a compatible installed NDK.
- Internet connection for Gradle dependencies and Minecraft game files.

### Windows

```bat
gradlew.bat :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug --console=plain
```

### Linux/macOS

```bash
./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug --console=plain
```

The debug APK will be created at:

```text
app_pojavlauncher/build/outputs/apk/debug/app_pojavlauncher-debug.apk
```

Release build:

```bash
./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleRelease --console=plain
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`.

## Installing the debug APK

```bash
adb install -r app_pojavlauncher/build/outputs/apk/debug/app_pojavlauncher-debug.apk
```

For a specific device:

```bash
adb -s <device_id> install -r app_pojavlauncher/build/outputs/apk/debug/app_pojavlauncher-debug.apk
```

## Ely.by

XDAetherium adds a dedicated **Ely.by Account** login method.

How it works:

1. The launcher authenticates through Ely.by's Yggdrasil-compatible API.
2. The account is saved as a normal launcher Minecraft profile.
3. For Ely.by accounts, the launcher adds `authlib-injector` as a Java agent when starting the game.
4. Minecraft receives session/profile/textures through Ely.by, so Ely.by skins work in-game.
5. For the main menu, the launcher separately downloads the Ely.by skin PNG, crops the face and overlay layer, and caches it as the profile head.

If the menu skin does not update immediately, restart the launcher or reselect the Ely.by account.

## APK optimization

The build is configured for ARM devices:

```gradle
abiFilters "arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a"
```

This reduces APK size and removes unused x86/x86_64 libraries. If x86/x86_64 support is needed, the ABI filters and LWJGL assets must be restored separately.

## Before publishing to GitHub

Before publishing a public repository:

- Do not publish signing credentials or keystore passwords. Keep them in environment variables, `local.properties`, or another local file ignored by Git.
- Do not commit `local.properties`, build logs, temporary APKs, keystores, or personal files.
- Keep the original `LICENSE` and attribution.
- State that this project is a fork/modification of Amethyst/PojavLauncher/Boardwalk.
- If you publish an APK release, publish the matching source code for that release.

## Release signing

Release signing values can be provided through environment variables or `local.properties`:

```properties
xdaetherium.release.storeFile=release.jks
xdaetherium.release.storePassword=...
xdaetherium.release.keyAlias=...
xdaetherium.release.keyPassword=...
```

Equivalent environment variables:

```text
XDAETHERIUM_RELEASE_STORE_FILE
XDAETHERIUM_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
XDAETHERIUM_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
XDAETHERIUM_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
```
